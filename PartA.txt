The purpose of this project is to analyze the collision dataset for the city of Seattle and find out the factors affecting the severity of the accidents. By focusing on the prominent factors and working on them will help us to reduce the severity or number of accidents. Classification or Logistic Regression Models can br used to determine the relation and intensity respectively of the factors leading to severe accident in cars.

3. Target Audience
